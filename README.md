New Type Works Hackathon: Submit a homepage for club using HTML/CSS. Feel free to use any other libraries if needed.

A link to the live project: https://celebrated-douhua-ab0474.netlify.app/

It uses simple HTML/CSS to display information about our club. We then use Bootstrap to level up the design.
